# appendages

This repo contains all appendages used in ArduinoGen, RIP, RIP_COM, and diag. All ArduinoGen appendages go in the arduino_gen folder. All others go in the rip folder. If you make an appendage for one you are expected to complete it by making all parts of it. Further explanations are in the individual folders.
